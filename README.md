**some basic design standers**

try and keep coments in mark down explaing what a block of code dose and in line only explaing a line or two

wrender all but the last images inside ```if debug == 1``` staments

do varibles in whole word cammelCase

exeptions for i and j during for loops when they repersent a single number but not when they repsent anything else

if a section of code uses magic numbers put `#MAGIC` at the top of it so we can easily find where there is magic numbers that need to be taken out
